<h3>Electronic Communication</h3>
<h4>Use of Lists</h4>
<p>OCI does not rent, trade, or sell email addresses. OCI may use
  email addresses that it has obtained during business interactions.
  OCI uses this information to contact customers, so that we may answer
  customer questions, acknowledge the receipt and dispatch of customer
  orders, send customer renewal notices, forward software problem
  notifications, and to send occasional announcements about OCI events,
  to those customers who have not opted out of receiving such announcements.
  These announcements are short straightforward messages that contain
  pointers to online resources where customers may explore the information
  more fully. Such announcements will be relevant to the products
  or services purchased.  </p>
<h4>Postal Mail</h4>
<p>OCI may use the postal addresses of its customers to mail invoices,
  products, and announcements from OCI. The names and mailing addresses
  of customers who have not opted out (see below) may be used internally
  for rare special mailings. OCI customer names and mailing addresses
  are never sold or given to outside organizations or companies. </p>
<h4>Opt-Out</h4>
 <p>Our site gives you the opportunity to opt out from either receiving
   email communications, or from having your name and address being
   used for future OCI Company activities. However to do so may result
   in your being unaware of any issues which might arise regarding
   software purchased through OCI. Opting out during the course of
   business transactions may result in our being unable to provide
   you with a quality experience. </p>
 <p>To opt out send a blank email to <a href="mailto:optout@objectcomputing.com">optout (AT) objectcomputing.com</a>.  </p>
 <p>If your job description changes and it is no longer appropriate
   to receive notifications please consider sending OCI a designee
   so as to maintain continuity. </p>

   complete service. OCI is not responsible for the privacy practices
