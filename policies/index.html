<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<h4>Our Goals</h4>

    gathered when visiting our web pages. We value your visits to
    our web site and want you to conclude your business with us in

  </p><h4>The Usage of your Information</h4>
  <p>OCI maintains a customer database that contains mailing, billing,
    and customer profile information, as well as a record of each
    customer's product purchases and registrations for business management
    and customer service activities. The information in these databases
    is used by authorized OCI staff and suppliers to process orders,
    charges, mail invoices, track shipments, purchases, renewal notices,
    announcements, and to respond to customer inquiries. Customer
    records are maintained for as long as three years following a
    transaction. Purchase and registration databases may be retained
    for up to three years.

  </p><h4>Personal Information</h4>
  <p>Personal information is stored in a relational database and standard
    security methods are used to protect it. We require full confirmation
    of identity before releasing information back to the user for
    update over the Web.
  </p><h4>Security</h4>

<p>Commercial information is obtained
  using our secure Web server and may be stored on our machines. When
  the data are stored, we use public key encryption on the sensitive
  data and require our staff to supply a private key to decrypt it.
  When passing such information internally over the Internet, we use
