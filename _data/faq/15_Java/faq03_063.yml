Q: Is TAO interoperable with Sun's Java JDK 1.3 ORB?

A: >
 Yes, but there is an issue with Codesets supported by Sun's Java 1.3 ORB.
 <p> Sun's Java 1.3 ORB does not support character sets UTF-8 and UTF-16.
  To use Sun's Java 1.3 ORB with TAO, you must disable the generation of optional
 standard profile components in IORs generated by TAO.  To do so, use the
 following ORB initialization option with TAO servers that generate IORs that
 will be used by Java 1.3 ORB clients: </p><p>
 </p><pre>    -ORBStdProfileComponents 0</pre>
