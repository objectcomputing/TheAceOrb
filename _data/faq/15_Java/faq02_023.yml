Q: Does TAO support a Java binding?

A: >
 TAO is
 a C++ ORB.  Any other CORBA compliant ORB can interoperate with TAO (as well
 as other CORBA compliant ORBs).  There are several free Java ORBs available,
 such as JacORB.  For more information on TAO and JacORB, see LINK:JacORB:.
 <p>
 Work on a real-time Java ORB, ZEN, is currently in progress.  For more information, see LINK:075: or <a href="http://www.zen.uci.edu/">http://www.zen.uci.edu/</a>.
