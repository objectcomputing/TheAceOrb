Q: How can I use TAO's Naming Service with my Java ORB?

A: >
 When I use the TAO name service, JavaORB returns an org.omg.CORBA.INV_OBJREF
 in resolve_initial_references("NameService").
 <p>
 There's a file called NS_Resolve.java in<br>
 </p><pre>    $TAO_ROOT/examples/Simulator/DOVEBrowser<br></pre> that contains
 code which discovers TAO's Naming Service via the multicast discovery mechanism.
  Hooking that into the initial references table is ORB-specific, however. 
 <p> Alternately, you can bypass the TAO Naming Service's multicast mechanism
 and connect your Java application to it directly.  For an example which uses
 TAO and JacORB, see LINK:074:
