Q: Why is my &quot;client&quot; thread dispatching requests?

A: >
 By default,
 TAO attempts to efficiently use all the threads that are given to it.  This
 includes "client" threads that have sent a request and are waiting for a
 reply from the server.  While waiting, these threads enter the normal thread
 pool reactor event loop.  This means that any incoming requests (assuming
 that the process is also a server) may be dispatched using that thread. Such
 a situation is referred to as a &quot;nested upcall&quot;.
 
 <p> This has a couple of side effects that surpise many people.  First,
 it is possible for even a single threaded server to process more than one
 request at the same time.  Second, if you try to allocate threads exclusively
 as "server" threads and "client" threads, the ORB will pay no attention to
 your idea of what these threads are and dispatch requests on both. </p>
 
 <p> Why is this the default behavior of TAO?  Mainly because nested upcalls avoid
 many potential deadlock situations.  One example is a simple callback operation
 with a single threaded client.  When the client sends a request to the server,
 the server sends a callback request back to the client.  If the client's
 only thread is waiting for the reply and not dispatching incoming requests,
 then a deadlock is now in place.  The default behavior allows the client
 ORB to process the callback request and send a reply to the server which
 frees the server ORB to send its reply back to the client. </p>
 
 <p> There however are situations where you may wish to prevent nested upcalls
 in your application. Some common reasons are:
 <ul>
 <li>Real-time applications which impose strict response times.
 <li>Resource limitations which impose concurrency limitations.
 <li>Short response time. The response will be buffered until the nested upcall
 unwinds.
 <li>Recursive nested upcalls may lead to unbounded stack growth, which will
 eventually crash the application.
