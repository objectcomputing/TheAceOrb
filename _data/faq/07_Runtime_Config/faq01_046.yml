Q: How do I get a TAO server to use IIOP v1.0 or v1.1?

A: >
 You must
 use the -ORBListenEndpoints option.  For further details, please refer to the <em>TAO
 Developer's Guide</em>, the chapter on "ORB Initialization Options." Alternately
 refer to $TAO_ROOT/docs/Options.html. <p>
 The short answer is:
 </p><p>
 -ORBListenEndpoints iiop://V.v@[hostname:[port]]
 </p><p> The V.v@ portion of this syntax informs the server to use a specific
 major and minor version of the specified protocol.  For example, to force
 a server to use IIOP v1.1 (instead of the default v1.2) on a host named "barney"
 at port 22000: </p><p>
 -ORBListenEndpoints iiop://1.1@barney:22000
 </p><p> If you always want to force use of IIOP 1.0 or 1.1, you can set the
 following macro values and rebuild TAO (and your application): </p><p>
 #define TAO_DEF_GIOP_MAJOR 1<br>
 #define TAO_DEF_GIOP_MINOR 0  [or 1]
 </p><p>
 These macros are typically set in $TAO_ROOT/tao/orbconf.h or $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h.
 <br>Correction to the "-ORBListenEndpoints" syntax.  It should be:<br>
 -ORBListenEndpoints iiop://1.0@[host][:port]<br>
 The hostname is not always required.
