Q: I'm not interested in using Codeset Negotiation, how can I disable it?
A: >
 You may disable the codeset negotiation feature completely by passing
 -ORBNegotiateCodesets 0 to ORB_init. When this is done, the TAO_Codeset library
 is not loaded, thus saving the memory and messaging overhead of codeset
 negotiation.
 <p>
 TAO may also be built with codeset negotiation off by default. This is done by
 editing ACE_wrappers/ace/config.h and adding
 <br>
 <code>#define TAO_NEGOTIATE_CODESETS 0</code>
 <p>
 This will set the internal default to not load the codeset library, but this
 can be overridden by supplying -ORBNegotiateCodesets 1 to ORB_init.
