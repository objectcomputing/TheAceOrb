Q: "Why do I get this: ACE_DLL::open failed for TAO_Codeset?"

A: >
 Codeset negotiation is an optional feature for TAO. It is implemented in a
 separate shared library, libTAO_Codeset.so, or TAO_Codeset.dll on Windows.
 Typically, TAO is not explicitly linked to the codeset library, rather it
 relies on the ACE Service Configuration framework to load the library for it.
 <p>
 The error in question is reported when ACE cannot find the Codeset library in
 the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or the runtime PATH on Windows. While most error or
 warning reports such as the one in question are guarded by a log-level test,
 this one is not, because the code in question is often used in static
 initializers, which are called before a log-level determination can be made.
