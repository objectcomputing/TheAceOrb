Q: How can I help extend TAO's functionality and add new features?

A: >
 TAO is open source and the development group welcomes code contributions.
 Active participation by users ensures a robust implementation.  Please refer to
 the terms and conditions relating to software submissions in
 the ACE, TAO, CIAO, and CoSMIC copyright and licensing
 information:
 <a
 href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/ACE-copying.html">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-copying.html</a>.
 In general, incorporation of your code into TAO results in it becoming "open" and the user
 community being protected by the ACE/TAO copyright and terms.
 <p>
 OCI can also provide consulting and software engineering resources to help you
 add new functionality into TAO or to span additional platforms.  We can also
 manage the inclusion of such code into the supported releases of new open
 source versions of TAO.  We can provide anonymity if you wish to avoid exposing
 your technical strategies in public forums, where your competition may be
 watching.  Contact <a href="mailto:sales@objectcomputing.com?subject=TAO%20FAQ%20%28maintained%20by%20OCI%20for%20the%20TAO%20Community%29">sales@objectcomputing.com</a> to discuss your project.
 </p><p> Open source software can add immeasurably to the development of a
 rich infrastructure, and the provision of a high degree of application
             interoperability, from which we all may derive benefit.  Read
