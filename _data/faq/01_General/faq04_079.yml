Q: What's the relationship between OCI's TAO and the DOC Group's TAO?

A: >
 <em>OCI's Distribution of TAO</em> is signified with a
 letter in the version number (e.g., TAO 1.3a, TAO 1.4a),
 whereas DOC Group release version numbers do not include a letter
 (e.g., TAO 1.4, TAO 1.5).  OCI patch releases also indicate a
 patch level (e.g., TAO 1.4a_p12), whereas DOC Group beta kits
 indicate the beta number after a major release (e.g., TAO
 1.5.4).
 
 <p>
 Each OCI release is derived from a DOC Group version (for
 example, TAO 1.4a was derived from TAO 1.4.3), but
 an OCI release does not correspond exactly to any DOC Group release.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 OCI seeks to maintain extremely stable, fully-tested, open
 source products backed by
 <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/support/index.html">commercial support</a>,
 <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/training/index.html">training</a>,
 <a href="http://www.ociweb.com/consulting">consulting</a>, and
 accompanied by
 <a
 href="{{site.baseurl}}/purchase/index.html">extensive
 documentation and binaries on CD-ROM available for
 purchase</a>.  Many organizations
 desire a commercially-supported release of TAO as a basis for
 their mission critical applications.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/">DOC Group's</a>
 primary focus is <a
 href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/research.html">research and development</a>
 rather than commercial support.  Support is provided on a
 "best effort" basis through the public <a
 href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO-mail.html">tao-users
 mailing list</a>, and is often excellent.  However, more
 "predictable" support is availble from
 <a href="{{site.baseurl}}">OCI</a> and
 <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/commercial-support.html">other organizations</a>.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 OCI selects a reasonably stable DOC Group release as the basis
 for each OCI distribution.  OCI then builds and tests across
 over 50 combinations of hardware, operating systems, C++
 compilers, and build flags.  As bugs are encountered, they are
 fixed directly (and the fix is contributed back to DOC), fixed
 by integrating an existing DOC fix (depending on the severity
 and the degree of entanglement), or documented (if a fix is
 too involved to be accomplished without sponsorship).
 </p>
 
 <p> In addition, OCI applies various enhancements, sponsored by our customers.
  We also integrate these back into the DOC group repository. </p>
  
 <p>
 OCI also packages select binaries (custom builds are also
 available -- see <a
 href="{{site.baseurl}}/product/index.html">{{site.baseurl}}/product/index.html</a>)
 and makes them available for purchase on CD-ROM.  Since OCI's
 distribution of TAO is still open source, OCI also distributes
 the source code and all patches free of charge (see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads">{{site.baseurl}}/downloads</a>).
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In OCI distributions, the original DOC Group <code>ChangeLog</code>s are preserved;
 OCI changes are documented in <code>OCIChangeLog</code> and <code>OCIReleaseNotes.html</code>
 files, included in the source code distribution.  See, for example, the latest
 <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/1.4a/OCIReleaseNotes.html">OCI TAO 1.4a Release Notes</a>.
