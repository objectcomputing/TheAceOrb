Q: What's a PRF?

A: >
 "PRF"
 refers to the PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM, i.e., <code>$ACE_ROOT/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM. </code>
 This boilerplate document is found in both DOC distributions and OCI distributions. 
 <p> The odds of getting questions answered, bugs fixed, etc., goes up significantly
 when you report problems using the PRF because it insures that developers
 and support personnel get the most commonly required information right away.
  Failure to use the PRF means that those folks have to spend valuable time
 (yours and theirs) having a conversation to get that information just to
 start debugging.  Unless you've got a paid support contract, there's even
 a chance that nobody will answer! </p><p>
 So, always use the PRF!
