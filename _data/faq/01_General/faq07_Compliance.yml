Q: With which OMG CORBA specifications is TAO compliant? 
A: >
 Compliance, just like source code and the specifications
 themselves, is a moving target.  Each version of TAO is
 compliant with various OMG CORBA specifications.
 
 <p>
 Each version of the <a
 href="{{site.baseurl}}/purchase/index.html"><em>TAO Developer's Guide</em></a>
 includes an appendix that discusses compliance of that version
 of TAO in detail.  These appendices are available via <a
