Q: How do I obtain, configure, and build ACE and TAO on Linux?

A: >
 This FAQ provides basic instructions for installing and
 building ACE+TAO for Linux.  ACE+TAO can also be used on other
 major modern operating systems, such as Windows, Solaris,
 AIX, and HP-UX, and some real-time and embedded
 operating systems, such as VxWorks, LynxOS, Timesys Linux, and
 Windows CE.

 <pre>
 Hardware Requirements

   - CPU: ACE+TAO can be configured to build on a variety of 32
     and 64 bit processors (Intel, AMD, PowerPC)
   - Memory: 512 MB (more memory improves compile speed)
   - Hard Drive Space: 256MB swap + 500 MB up to several GB
     free (depending upon how much you build)

 Operating System Requirements

   - Linux 2.6.x kernel

 C++ Compiler Requirements

   - gcc 3.3.x (or later)

 Other Software Requirements

   - OCI's Distribution of TAO version 1.6a latest patch
     release or the latest release or micro release of ACE+TAO
     (see instructions below for obtaining and installing
     ACE+TAO)
   - GNU gunzip and GNU tar for extracting software archives
   - GNU make
   - Perl v5.6.1 or newer (recommended, but not required)

 Obtaining and Installing OCI TAO

   1. Download the latest release of OCI TAO 1.6a from:

      <a href="https://download.objectcomputing.com/TAO-1.6a/">https://download.objectcomputing.com/TAO-1.6a/</a>

      or download the latest release or micro release of ACE+TAO from:

      <a href="http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/">http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/</a>

   2. Extract the archive into a path with no spaces in the path
      name (e.g., /opt/ACE_wrappers)

   3. Set ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT, PATH, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
      variables.

      For example, if ACE+TAO are installed in /opt/ACE_wrappers,
      the variables will look like this:

      ACE_ROOT=/opt/ACE_wrappers
      TAO_ROOT=$ACE_ROOT/TAO
      PATH will include the directory $ACE_ROOT/bin
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH will include the directory $ACE_ROOT/lib

   4. Create a file named config.h in $ACE_ROOT/ace with the following
      contents:

      #include "ace/config-linux.h"

   5. Create a file named platform_macros.GNU in
      $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude with the following contents:

      debug=1     # (or debug=0)
      optimize=0  # (or optimize=1)
      include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU

   6. Build ACE+TAO using the following commands:

      cd $TAO_ROOT
      make

      The above commands will build the ACE and TAO libraries,
      TAO IDL compiler, gperf, ORB services libraries and
      executables, and some common utilities.  They will not
      build any examples, tests, or performance tests.
      (Separate directories and GNUmakefiles exist for them.)
      Libraries will be installed in $ACE_ROOT/lib.  Some
      executables will be installed in $ACE_ROOT/bin, others
      (the ORB services executables) will be installed in their
      source directories.

      Note that it is possible to distinguish builds by architecture
      using the $ARCH environment variable. if $ARCH is set, the libs
      will be installed in $ACE_ROOT/lib/$ARCH. If you are using $ARCH
      to control the target, the value must not contain spaces. For
      example, "Linux" or "x86_64" are acceptible but "Linux x86_64"
      is not.

   7. If there are no GNUmakefiles, you will need to generate them
      using MakeProjectCreator (MPC) (requires Perl as listed above)
      with the following commands:

      cd $TAO_ROOT
      $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace TAO_ACE.mwc
