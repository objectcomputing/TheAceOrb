Q: How can I build debug applications with non-debug libraries?

A: >
 During development, you will normally want to build your
 application code with debugging enabled.  However, you may be
 using non-debug versions of the ACE, TAO, and CIAO libraries.
 Depending upon your platform and development environment,
 special care must be taken to make sure your debug-enabled
 application can link against non-debug ACE, TAO, and CIAO
 libraries.<br/><br/>

 On platforms that use GNU Make, all you have to do to enable
 debugging in your application is set the <code>debug</code>
 build flag to <code>1</code> when you build your application
 code.  You can do this by setting <code>debug=1</code> on the
 <code>make</code> command line, as follows:<br/>

 <pre>
 make debug=1
 </pre>

 Or, you can set <code>debug=1</code> in your
 <code>platform_macros.GNU</code> file when you build your
 application.  <em>Note: If you have <code>debug=1</code> in
 <code>platform_macros.GNU</code> when you build the ACE, TAO,
 and CIAO libraries, they will be built with debugging enabled,
 too.</em><br/><br/>

 On some platforms, such as Windows with Visual C++, the ACE,
 TAO, and CIAO library names may have a <em>modifier</em>
 appended to the library name to indicate whether it was built
 with a debug, static, MFC, or some other configuration.  For
 example, in a debug build, the name of the ACE shared library
 will be <code><strong>ACEd.dll</strong></code>, whereas in a
 non-debug (release) build, the name of the ACE shared library
 will be <code><strong>ACE.dll</strong></code>.<br/><br/>

 On these platforms, if you build your application with a debug
 configuration, and you are using project files generated by
 MPC, the linker will, by default, look for libraries with the
 "d" debug modifier appended to the library name.  If you are
 building your debug application against non-debug libraries,
 you need to tell the linker to look for the unmodified library
 names.  You can do this by directly editing the project
 settings (e.g., to remove the "d" from the library names).
 Or, you can use the
 <code><strong>-value_template</strong></code> MPC option to
 override the default definition of the library modifier when
 you generate your project files.<br/><br/>

 For example, suppose your application's MPC workspace file is
 <code>MyApp.mwc</code> and suppose you are using Visual C++
 7.1.  If you want to build your application against the same
 set of non-debug ACE, TAO, and CIAO libraries, regardless of
 whether you build the debug or release configuration, you can
 use the following command to generate your application's
 project and solution files:<br/>

 <pre>
 $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type vc71 -value_template lib_modifier=
 </pre>

 The <code>-value_template</code> option in the above command
 sets the value of the <code>lib_modifier</code> template
 variable to an empty string, which causes no modifier to be
 added to the library names with which your application will
 link, regardless of which configuration (debug or release) you
 build.<br/><br/>

 Watch out for build problems if you have any settings in your
 <code>config.h</code> file that depend upon having debugging
 enabled, for example:<br/>

 <pre>
 #if defined(_DEBUG)
 #undef __ACE_INLINE__
 #endif
 </pre>
