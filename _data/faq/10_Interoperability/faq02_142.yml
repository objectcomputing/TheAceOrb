Q: What ORBs does TAO interoperate with?

A: >
 There
 are many different interpretations of the word "interoperate".   In general,
 TAO works with any ORB that adheres to the relevant OMG CORBA standards.
  If it doesn't work, then there is a bug in one of the ORB implementations.
  If it is with TAO it is usually corrected quickly (even quicker if you help
 document and debug the problem).  Other ORB implementors also fix these problems
 quite quickly when they are brought to their attention. <p> There is no definitive list of ORBs that a particular version of TAO
 works with.  Here are some ORBs that users have reported successfully using
 with TAO in the past:<br>

 <ul>
 <li> Orbix (3.x, 2000)
 <li> Visibroker
 <li> JacORB
 <li> OpenORB
 <li> Sun JDK ORB
 <li> ORBExpress
 <li> INTERSTAGE
 <li> CorbaScript
 <li> Orbacus
 <li> ZEN
 <li> MICO
 <li> OmniORB<br>
 </ul>
 There are probably others.<br>
