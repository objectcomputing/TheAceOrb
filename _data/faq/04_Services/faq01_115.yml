Q: I'm having weird problems with the Naming Service.  How can I solve them?

A: >
 More than
 likely you're having problems related to multicast discovery of the Naming
 Service.  Multicast was the default mechanism for finding the
 Naming Service in older versions of TAO.  Symptoms range
 anywhere from a client not being able to find the Naming
 Service at all, to finding it sometimes, to just completely bizarre and inexplicable behavior. <p>
 So, before you do anything, try it all again, but this time turn off multicast discovery.  See LINK:004:.
