Q: Why is my application leaking memory when I use local objects?

A: >
 It is likely that your objects are using reference counting to manage
 their life cycle.  The CORBA::LocalObject class provides an empty
 implementation of the _add_ref() and _remove_ref() methods.  However, the
 TAO_Local_RefCounted_Object implements real reference counting through these
 methods.

 The solution to your memory leak may be as simple as inheriting from
 TAO_Local_RefCounted_Object instead of CORBA::LocalObject.
