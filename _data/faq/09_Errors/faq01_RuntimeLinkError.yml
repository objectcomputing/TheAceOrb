Q: Why do I experience a run-time link error, even though my    path and environment variables are set correctly and I have a fresh    build tree?

A: >
 You may have an older version of one of the ACE, TAO, or CIAO
    libraries somewhere in your library search path (e.g.,
    <code>PATH</code> on Windows, <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> on
    Linux) that you don't know about, even though you have only one
    build tree of ACE+TAO+CIAO.  For example, the CoSMIC tool chain
    installer ships with the ACE libraries and installs them on your
    system.  The same is true of OCI's TAO distribution CDs.
 
 <p>
    If you do have an out-dated version of one of the ACE, TAO, or CIAO
    libraries (e.g., <code>ACE.dll</code>), and  its path appears in
    the library search path before <code>$ACE_ROOT/lib</code> from your
    build tree, you will have run-time link errors.  The run-time
    linker tries to link your program against the first occurrence of
    the library that it finds in the library search path.

    You can confirm that this is the problem you are having by moving
    the problematic library in your build tree to a backup file and
    re-running your application.  If you still experience the run-time
    link error, then you probably have another (stale) version of the
    problematic library on your system.  (The <code>ldd</code> command
    on Linux and Unix can be very helpful in tracking down where the
    out-dated library is located.)  To correct the problem, ensure that
    <code>$ACE_ROOT/lib</code> comes first in the library search path.
    On Windows, you will need to restart your terminal windows and
    development environment.
