Q: I've just built the libraries and they're <strong>HUGE</strong>...how can I make them smaller?

 See LINK:019: for a more general discussion of TAO program/library sizes.
 <p>
 This all
 depends upon your definition of "huge" and how you built the libraries. 
 If you consider a few megabytes to be huge and you've built optimized, nodebug,
 and minimum CORBA, then that's the way life is currently. <p> If, on the other hand, you're looking at the size of the files and you
 built the defaults, then the first thing you need to do is understand that
 the size of the file is NOT the same as the size of the code.  When compiling
 with debug information, the compiler adds symbol information to the libraries,
 and that symbol information is <em>massive</em>.  What you need to do is look at
 the code size.  Using the WindRiver GNU toolchain, you can use <code>sizeppc</code>
 to do this, e.g.,<br>
 </p><pre>
   $ sizeppc libACE.so
   text    data    bss     dec     hex     filename
   626392  65036   1316    692744  a9208   libACE.so
 
   $ ls -l libACE.so
   -rwxrwxr-x   1 cleeland distcomp 31181587 Mar 16 10:10 libACE.so*
 </pre>
 So, you can see that the file size is 30Mb, but the code size is 692k.  Quite a different number.  The "size" results can be compared to the available memory on the target system.  Use both the "memShow" and "adrSpaceShow" commands from the target-resident VxWorks shell to see how much memory is available.
 <p>
 There are various strategies for making the libraries smaller, and all involve rebuilding.  Specifically, you can build:
 </p><p>
 <ul>
 <li> <strong>nodebug</strong> (debug=0) which will eliminate symbols and debugging messages<br>
 <li> <strong>minimumCORBA</strong>, which will only compile functionality specified by the Minimum CORBA specification<br>
 <li> <strong>ACE only for TAO</strong>, which will only compile the portions of ACE required by TAO
 </ul>
 <br>An often-used
 technique for keeping library sizes small and still debuggable is to build
 the entire library nondebug, then only build the pieces you need to debug
 with debug on.  This allows you to debug those pieces, but not suffer through
 the problems that large file sizes in libraries cause (e.g., longer download/boot
 times). <br>
 Here is a shortcut to rebuilding a lib with debug=0.
 But:
 <ol>
 <li> It doesn't remove debugging statements.
 <li> You have to be careful to not remove relocation symbols
    on VxWorks, so that you can load the lib.  For example,
    use something like stripppc --strip-unneeded, or
    strip386 --strip-debug
 <li> stripppc is broken on Tornado 2, Windows host.  It won't let
    you create the output file, so it's not of any use.
 </ol>
