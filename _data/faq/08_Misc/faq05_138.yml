Q: What is involved with using std library (inc stl) with ACE/TAO?

A: >
 There are several conditional directives that are relevant:<br>
 <ul>
 <li> ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY -- Causes ACE to #include the standard libraries
 where appropriate instead of older style runtime libraries, or defining its 
 own equivalent. (ie &lt;cstdio&gt; instead of &lt;stdio.h&gt; or &lt;memory&gt; instead of 
 creating its own auto_ptr)<br>
 <li> ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB -- This causes ACE to define "using 
 std::xxx" for all the std classes it uses. I've never messed with this one, 
 so I'm not sure of all the ramifications. I notice that it is defined by 
 default for most (all?) windows compilers. <br>
 <li> ACE_HAS_STDCPP_STL_INCLUDES -- This seems to be used only in ace/IOStream.h.
 It  causes ACE to use &lt;string&gt; instead of &lt;String.h&gt;. It's not defined for 
 VC++, but is for some other win32 compilers. I've never used this one either.
 </ul>
 In practice, I typically define ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY, and use stl and
 other std objects in my code. You can still use std library functions and 
 objects without defining ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY, but it can be a hassle
 because of duplicate definitions. (e.g. std::cout &amp; cout are different, so 
 you have to explicitly use std:: most places, and you can't use them 
 interchangeably)<br>
  In practice it is fairly common to use ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY. I always
 use this, and prefer the standard library to ACE where there is overlap.
 (ie std::map or hash_map over ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex)  Of course this can
 be a portability issue. <br>
