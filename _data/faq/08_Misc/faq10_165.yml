Q: How can my TAO client obtain information about the endpoint (e.g., IP address and port for IIOP) it is using to send a request?

A: >
 The TAO::Transport::IIOP::Current interface can be used to obtain
  information about the local and remote endpoints. Please see example code
  in LINK:164:. Similar code can be used by the client to obtain information 
  about the endpoint used to send a request. Note since the transport
  information is only available on client side at interceptor points
  (within send_request, send_poll(), receive_reply(), receive_exception() and 
  receive_other ()), TAO must be built with support for interceptors if the 
  client side needs Transport::Current functionality.
