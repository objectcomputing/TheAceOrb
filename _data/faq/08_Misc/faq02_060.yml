Q: Which thread does TAO use to dispatch a request?

A: >
 The answer to this depends on a number of conditions:
 <ul>
 <li> If the client is collocated with the servant and collocation is enabled,
 then the request is serviced on the client's thread.  Collocation can be
 disabled via the option: <code>-ORBCollocation no</code><br>
 <li> If the client is not in the same process as the servant (or collocation
 is disabled), then the concurrency strategy of the servant's ORB determines
 the servicing thread.  By default, this is the same thread where <code>orb-&gt;run()</code>
 or <code>orb-&gt;perform_work()</code> is called.  You can also specify a thread-per-connection
 model via the <code>-ORBConcurrency</code> option and a threadpool model by using the
 thread pool reactor.
