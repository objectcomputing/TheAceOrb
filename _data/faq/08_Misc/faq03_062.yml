Q: How can I detect when a connection between a client and server is broken?

 <p> You cannot directly detect when this happens.  You could write a pluggable
 protocol that informs your application when a connection dies, but that's
 about it. </p><p> Typically behind this question is the issue: how can I detect if
 my client died. Using connections for that is a very bad idea:  the client
 or server ORBs may close the connection just because it is idle for too long
 or there may not be a physical connection between two ORBs (they may be collocated
 or using shared memory to communicate).  There can also be multiple connections
 between a given client-server pair.  In CORBA, connections are hidden, and
 can come and go as needed.  Trying to rely on them to establish if the client
 is still there does not work. </p><p> In general you are better off using some application-level session
 object that gets destroyed by the client when it terminates gracefully, and
 that gets destroyed by an Evictor if it has been idle or unable to contact
 the client for too long. <br>
