Q: How can my TAO clients and servers communicate when the network goes down?

A: >
 Assuming that the clients and servers are local to one machine, it is
 possible by using "localhost".  For instance, you could have a Name Service
 running that is listening on the ethernet adapter and localhost:
 
 <pre>
   Naming_Service -ORBListenEndpoints "iiop://hostname:11223;iiop://localhost:11223"
 </pre>
 
 If the network for "hostname" goes down, this Name Service could still be
 accessed by a server running locally using the following:
 
 <pre>
   server -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:hostname:11223,iiop:localhost:11223/NameService
 </pre>
 
 Regardless of the state of the network on which "hostname" is registered, the
 server will be able to communicate with the Name Service due to the
 localhost endpoint.
