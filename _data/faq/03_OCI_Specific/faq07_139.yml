  You're always welcome to send a question.  However, the disposition of your
 request depends upon whether or not you have a technical support contract
 with OCI:  <ul>
 <li>
 <b>If you have a technical support contract with OCI,
 someone</b> will begin addressing the issue and <b>will follow
 up with you according to the provisions outlined in your
 support contract.</b>
 
 </li><li>
 <b>If you do <em>not</em> have a technical support contract with OCI,</b>
 someone will still review the support request and may get
 back to you, but <b>we cannot guarantee that we will have
 time to work on the problem without a support contract.</b>
 </li></ul>
