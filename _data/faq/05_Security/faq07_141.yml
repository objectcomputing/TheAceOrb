Q: How can I use a non-security enabled Naming Service with a security (SSLIOP) enabled client?

A: >
 When security
 is enabled in a CORBA client's ORB, all invocations will be attempted using
 a secure connection.  However, the Naming Service for example may not be
 set up to use security.  Invocations on that Naming Service will result in
 a CORBA::INV_POLICY exception since the client is unable to make a secure/protected
 invocation on that non-security enabled Naming Service.<br> To correct this
 problem, protected invocations via the Naming Service's object reference
 must be disabled.  This is achieved by setting a policy override on the Naming
 Service's object reference like so:<br>
 <pre>  // Disable protection on Naming Service invocations.<br>
   Security::QOP qop = Security::SecQOPNoProtection;<br>
   CORBA::Any no_protection;
   no_protection &lt;&lt;= qop;<br>
   // Create the Security::QOPPolicy.
   CORBA::Policy_var policy =
     orb-&gt;create_policy (Security::SecQOPPolicy,
                         no_protection);<br>
   CORBA::PolicyList policy_list (1);
   policy_list.length (1);
   policy_list[0] = CORBA::Policy::_duplicate (policy.in ());<br>
   // Get a reference to Naming Context
   CORBA::Object_var obj =
   orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references ("NameService");<br>
   // Create an object reference that uses plain IIOP (i.e. no
   // protection).
   CORBA::Object_var unprotected_obj =
     naming_context_object-&gt;_set_policy_overrides (policy_list,
                                                   CORBA::SET_OVERRIDE);<br>
   // Narrow to a CosNaming::NamingContext
   CosNaming::NamingContext_var naming_context =
     CosNaming::NamingContext::_narrow (unprotected_obj.in ());<br></pre>
  This is based on TAO's Secure_Invocation test client side code in $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests/Security/Secure_Invocation/client.cpp.
  (TAO 1.2 or better)<br>
  The above policy override code is standard and should be portable to all
 ORBs that support the SecurityLevel2::QOPPolicy quality-of-protection client-side
 policy. <br>Don't
 forget to include "orbsvcs/SecurityC.h"  (this is TAO-specific) to pull in
 the Security QoP policy related constants and types. <br>
