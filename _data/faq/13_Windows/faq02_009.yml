Q: Why do I encounter linking errors when building Debug applications in Windows with Visual C++?

A: >
 If you're linking debug versions of an executable or DLL and have unresolved symbols, there are several possible reasons:<br>
 <ol>
 <li> Is your library path correct?<br>
      (Check Tools|Options|Directories|Libraries or your project settings.)<br>
 <li> Are you linking in the ACE, TAO, and possibly orbsvcs libraries?<br>
      (Check Build|Settings|Link)<br>
 <li> Are you linking with the right library names?<br>
      If you are building your application against a Debug configuration
      of ACE+TAO, the names of the libraries will have the letter "d"
      in them (e.g., aced.lib, TAOd.lib, CosNamingd.lib).  If you are
      using a Release configuration of ACE+TAO, the "d" will not be
      present in the library names.<br>
 <li> Have you installed or built the Debug configuration of ACE+TAO?<br>
      If you have only installed the non-Debug version of TAO, you will not
      be able to build Debug executables.  To check this, do one of the
      following:<ol>
        <li> Build the Release configuration of the executable; or
        <li> Remove _DEBUG from the list of preprocessor definitions.
      </ol>
      If the build succeeds, then you probably have a non-Debug version of
      TAO.<br>
 </ol>
