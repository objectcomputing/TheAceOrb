Q: Does OCI's version of TAO contain MFC libraries?

A: >
 <p>
 <em>MFC Libraries</em> are libraries built with the ACE_HAS_MFC variable
 defined.  See LINK:137: for more details of what this means.
 </p>
 <p>
 The OCI-produced binary installation kits  do not contain MFC libraries for Windows platforms.
 You will need to recompile ACE and TAO in order to build them with MFC libraries.
