Q: Where can I see performance comparisons between TAO and &lt;some other ORB&gt;?

A: >
 It's not
 as easy to compare the performance of ORBs as generically as one might compare,
 e.g., the performance of microprocessors.  There are no standard benchmarks
 available at the present.  Thus, any evaluation of performance of an ORB
 is largely dependent on the application and its characteristics as well as
 the environment in which it's running (such as over an ATM network vs. ethernet
 vs. wireless, etc.). <p> That said, you might be able to get a better
 feeling of the situations in which various ORBs "shine" (performance-wise)
 by looking at some of the benchmarks available through the following links: </p>
 <ul>
 <li> <a href="http://nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz/projects.phtml?p=mbench&q=3">Distributed Systems Research Group, Charles University, Prague</a></li>
 <li> <a href="http://www.kegel.com/corba/">Dan Kegel's CORBA Page</a></li>
 <li> <a href="http://www.atl.external.lmco.com/projects/QoS/compare/dist_oo_compare_ipc.html">LMCO Advanced Technology Labs' Middleware Comparator</a></li>
 </ul>
 <p> Finally, don't forget that nothing comes without a cost, so carefully
 evaluate the entire ORB <em>package</em>, not just the performance. <br>
