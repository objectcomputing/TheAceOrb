Q: How can I reduce my compile time during development?

A: >
 Reducing compile time during development:<br>
 <br><b>Disable Optimization</b>:
 <p> When developing software that uses ACE+TAO you can reduce the time it
 takes to compile your software by not enabling you compiler's optimizer
 flags. These often take the form -O<n>.</p>
 <p> Disabling optimization for your application will come at the cost of run
 time performance, so you should normally only do this during
 development, keeping your test and release build optimized.</p>
 <br><b>Disable Inlining</b>:
 <p> When compiler optimization is disabled, it is frequently the case that
 no inlining will be performed. In this case the ACE inlining will be
 adding to your compile time without any appreciable benefit. You can
 therefore decrease compile times further by build building your
 application with the -DACE_NO_INLINE C++ flag.</p>
 <p> In order for code built with -DACE_NO_INLINE to link, you will need to
 be using a version of ACE+TAO built with the "inline=0" make flag.</p>
 <p> In order to accommodate both inline and non-inline builds of your
 application it will be necessary to build two copies of your ACE+TAO
 libraries, one with inlining and one without. You can then use your
 ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT variables to point at the appropriate
 installation.</p>
