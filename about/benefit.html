    <h2>The Benefits of Open Source</h2>
    <p>The "Open Source Model" is not a religion. It is a very pragmatic
      way of evolving software in a rapidly changing environment. It harnesses
      the collective wisdom, experiences, expertise and requirements of
      its most demanding users to ensure that their needs are rapidly
      met. </p>
    <p>Any software company with expertise, the resources and the will
      can elect to provide whatever level of support they feel the market
      will bear. With complete access to the source code nobody has the
      edge that previously was only available to the owners of the proprietary
      software. Support is now open to competition. The quality of support
      is now open to market forces.</p>
    <p>It often has a lot of the same features as proprietary software:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Commercially available technical support </li>
      <li>Professional documentation </li>
      <li>Training classes </li>
      <li>Managed Release Schedules at reasonable intervals </li>
      <li>Binary distributions for popular platforms.</li>
      <li>Active User’s Groups exchanging experiences.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>But it also has the following additional features and benefits:</p>
    <h4>Configuration Management (platforms used, compilers supported,
      etc.) </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose your compiler: It improves your ability to write highly
        portable code if you can create a development environment with
        a compiler that spans many platforms. Many proprietary products
        lock you into a single compiler, often linked to the hardware
        platform. Open source products often support multiple compilers
        from which you can choose. </li>
      <li>If for some reason you do not want to upgrade the platform O/S,
        in lockstep with everyone else, you don't have to. You can stay
        at previous versions and add patches or enhancements selectively.
      </li>
      <li>If you have a special platform you want the software to run
        on. Do the port yourself and create an affinity group within the
        community to help you spread your maintenance activities. Don't
        let someone else dictate platform policy for your organization.
        You don't have to follow the crowd. </li>

      <li>If you are a platform vendor and you find your platform is no
        longer supported, or you think it is poorly supported. Support
        it yourself! Give your customer base insight into how to tune
        the software to maximize performance. No longer do you have to
        worry about a vendor having platform architectural biases, (suspected
        or real!) </li>
      <li>In general open source slows the pressure to support only a
        single or very narrow set of platforms. Open source is an inclusionary
        style for platforms versus the more usual exclusionary style (i.e.
        support for only popular platforms), traditionally adopted by
        vendors. The result is open source supports choice. Proprietary
        systems limit choice. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Revision Management and Product Evolution</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You don't need to negotiate putting code in escrow as insurance
        for critical projects. You have the source code now and forever.
      </li>
      <li>You can monitor the development activities and measure progress
        for yourself. No more blind acceptance of a vendor's optimistic
        delivery dates that are unlikely to be met. </li>

      <li>Everyone can beta test the next release. It is an open process,
        not restricted to a privileged few. You can verify its stability
        and features, then plan accordingly. </li>
      <li>It is released when the group feels it is ready, not just to
        meet revenue targets for management. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Enhancements </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You don't have to wait for the vendor to add features you need.
        If it is urgent, you can do it yourself. </li>
      <li>When you add features and submit back to the community, a lot
        of people you don't know, and don't have to pay, but are very
        smart, will help you improve it. They can't make bad ideas become
        good ideas, but they can turn good ideas into great ideas. </li>

      <li>If it is really important to you, you too can participate in
        the overall development process. You can influence schedules and
        priorities by contributing. </li>
      <li>If it is not that important, you can still enjoy the benefits.
        Nobody makes you contribute. </li>
      <li>You can patch the code yourself if you need it right away, and
        post it with the newsgroups to get really quick feedback. </li>
      <li>You don't have to upgrade if you don't want to. You have the
        source to support yourself at any release level that you choose.
      </li>
      <li>You do not pay for enhancements you do not necessarily want.
        You do not pay, period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Debugging </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>With source available you can use a debugger to navigate as
        your own code interacts with that of the product. In this way
        you can isolate bugs, both in your code and the product code,
        faster. (Developers consider this a huge benefit. The improved
        productivity is dramatic and substantial enough in itself to warrant
        consideration for open source as major element of the risk reduction
        strategy on any major project.) </li>
      <li>While stepping through the product code using a debugger, greater
        understanding can be gained in how the product works. Your code
        can cooperate with the middleware more effectively when you understand
        its behavior.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Testing </h4>
    <ul>

      <li>With access to the source code, people using a wide variety
        of platform, operating systems, and compiler combinations can
        compile, link, and run your code on their system to test for portability.
        This sort of scale, and parallel debug, cannot be easily duplicated
        within the confines of a single vendor's testing labs. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Documentation </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>People outside of the core development group are more likely
        to contribute additional user documentation. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Usability Issues</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>If you need deeper insight into the behavior of the software,
        it is easier to see with source code, than it is guessing or trying
        to use reverse engineering techniques. </li>
      <li>Interested users are more likely to exercise the code during
        beta activities as opposed to only working with the product after
        it's been released. This means there are more opportunities for
        user's ideas to be incorporated into the code. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Ownership</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Users are now stakeholders.</li>

      <li>Everyone must succeed or no-one succeeds.</li>
      <li>There is no adversarial relationship between vendor and client.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Third-party Tools</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>By having access to the source code, developers are better able
        to provide additional tools and add-on products that can enhance
        the code functionality. Without access to the source code developers
        must frequently reverse engineer file formats and API's. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Evaluations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No hassle evaluation. No time limit pressures. </li>
      <li>No limited use rules restricting the number of evaluators. Everyone
        who cares can get involved. </li>
      <li>No messy legal paperwork to process, or permission to seek.
        Only the evaluation consumes your time. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Benchmarking</h4>

    <p>Benchmarking is an important activity in evaluating if a product
      is right for you. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Many proprietary vendors make you sign agreements that prevent
        you from publishing benchmarks on their products. No such requirement
        from open source vendors! We have no interest in suing our stakeholders
        and partners. They can help us in improving the code. We do not
        want to hide our results or inhibit evaluation. </li>
      <li>Get those benchmarks out there and let the community assist
        you in building the right kind of benchmark. Share or improve
        what is already out there. Open source providers usually will
        package suggested benchmarks. Build on what is available, this
        will save you time. Add your benchmark code to the mix. Someone
        else will likely improve on it for you. The community will also
        help you interpret them. You must measure what matters. You cannot
        improve what you cannot measure. The more measuring going on,
        the more improvement will occur. </li>
      <li>Porting someone else's benchmark to your platform and comparing
        results helps us all understand implementation differences across
        platforms. This is an important insight for the evaluation process.
        Does a product mask or magnify the variation that occurs between
        platforms?</li>
      <li>Benchmarking when done right can cost a lot of resources. Open
        source approaches can provide you more leverage. Open approaches
        can help avoid errors in the selection process. </li>

      <li>Proprietary vendor benchmarks are often very selective. They
        portray the products in their best light. Open source benchmarks
        play to the market of free ideas. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Security </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Open source means what you see is what you get. You can inspect
        the code line by line to ensure that no disgruntled programmer
        has buried logic bombs, trapdoors, Trojan horses, viruses or any
        other nasty surprises in the code. </li>
      <li>You do not have to worry that being late with that license fee
        might result in a locked up system. No worries, as with proprietary
        systems, that the code may contain the means to disable the software,
        and effectively your business. Open source is not UCITA!</li>
      <li>No worry that the weak link in a security strategy might be
        some proprietary application with poor defensive measures. You
        can add security features to open source if you wish and ensure
        a consistent level of protection across all applications in the
        system. </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Licensing </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>There are no licensing fees! Neither development nor runtime.
      </li>
      <li>You can put open source software where you want it, when you
        want it. Performance and other considerations drive those decisions,
        not the licensing model constraints. </li>
      <li>No arguing with management about money for license upgrade funding
        just to stay current. Upgrading is now mostly a technical decision,
        not just a financial one. </li>
      <li>Your cost model for your products is more predictable, no more
        sweating about vendor licensing model changes, which might break
        your pricing strategy. </li>

      <li>There is no vendor to use a combination of licensing and proprietary
        extensions to keep you locked into an implementation. </li>
      <li>No worries that your vendor might disappear without trace leaving
        you with node locked software, a rollout coming up, and no way
        to implement more licenses. In other words, no way to go into
        production with your application.</li>
      <li>Switching costs are not inhibited, or influenced, because of
        their magnification due to the sheer volume of systems involved.
      </li>
      <li>You can recommend the software to others on its merits, without
        worrying about cost implications. </li>
      <li>You can build it into, or ship it with your products, as a way
        to help your customers, and to improve your product's utility,
        without affecting your pricing edge. </li>
      <li>Your own product's functionality can continue to be improved
        and take advantage of the open source product's improvements without
        worrying about the repercussions of your customers having to pay
        upgrade fees. They can stay current with minimal financial impact.
        Or you can ship the new version with your product. </li>

      <li>It levels the playing field for those smaller companies who
        cannot negotiate site licenses and other large discount programs
        that give larger companies an additional pricing edge. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Special Impact of Open Source on Middleware</h4>
    <p>Object middleware is a special kind of software. Its utility stems
      from its ability to ensure consistency and interoperability. The
      value middleware offers includes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to provide a standard, stable, consistent interface
        to a wide variety of applications, on a broad set of platforms
        and enable their inter-operability.</li>
      <li>It decouples service providers from service requesters.</li>

      <li>It enables parallel development of service and client.</li>
      <li>It hides implementation details behind standard interfaces.
        This allows the implementation to change without disrupting or
        breaking existing clients.</li>
      <li>It allows multiple clients to access the same services, often
        simultaneously.</li>
      <li>It frees the developers of distributed systems from the burden
        of developing networking software, allowing them to focus on their
        application’s particular needs.</li>
      <li>It enables the migration of services to new platforms, increasingly
        diverse and specialized communications technologies, operating
        systems, and implementation languages.</li>
      <li>It allows legacy systems to be "wrapped" in standard interfaces,
        giving them the ability to become distributed components as well.</li>

      <li>It allows co-existence of solutions employing multiple languages.</li>
      <li>It protects the existing legacy systems, and yet future proofs
        what you develop today against language, platform and communications
        obsolescence tomorrow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vendors of proprietary products are typically under pressure to
      differentiate their product with extensions. These value-added features
      can often lead to incompatibility and confusion. Vendors must balance
      standards compliance with maintaining an edge. It is not an easy
      task. A product that is fully standards compliant can be more easily
      replaced. To protect market share, middleware vendors must selectively
      add proprietary new features along with standard ones to maintain
      a lock on their client-base.</p>
    <p>Open source software has no such pressures. Often, as second-generation
      products, their value proposition is that they support the standard
      very closely. This is their way to differentiate themselves from
      the other products already present in the market place. They hope
      to use the consensus achieved in that standard and experiences from
      multiple product implementations, as a way to stabilize the technology
      domain, create a commodity item from that technology and thus create
      another stable building block in the technology layers that make
      up distributed systems. Users can then move on to other areas, higher
      up the ladder of abstraction, to advance technology and create new
      value.</p>
    <p>Applications are the true value added software. Middleware should
      be "low impedance" software for enabling application interoperability
      and systems diversity. Software historically has moved towards a
      monopoly, as a way to achieve easy interoperability via uniformity.
      Within the middleware market there should be enough diversity to
      foster innovation and yet with sufficient uniformity to enable cooperation.
      Open source software can act as a break on the natural progression
      towards a single dominant vendor. A progression, some would say,
      towards a monopoly.</p>

    <p>In open source the users contribute extensions that they want to
      see in the product. This might include extensions beyond the standard
      but they are created by a user's need to inter-operate, not a vendor's
      motivation to lock in. These activities can become the basis for
      a standards submission as they can prove the viability of an approach
      and enable many users to validate their utility, in real life situations.</p>
