                        for VC++ 7.1/8/9/10, and others. It can be extended to
                        other make systems as well. MPC documentation is available in the distribution

                        TAO, using GNU Make permits the leveraging of the existing build system
                        distributed with ACE &amp; TAO. Use <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/">gmake</a>
                        version 3.80 (or better), as previous versions have caused build problems on

                       turned out to be not as tolerant first though. The problem was identified

                       file system.</LI>

                     <LI>add a new command line argument to the logWalker utility to enable
                       the production of finer-grained output files when multiple files for
                       output is requested. See $TAO_ROOT/utils/logWalker/readme for info
                       on the -dd option as descriped in the README file.</LI>
                     <LI>Fixed a variety of build dependency issues and other minor bugs

                     Features added and bugs/fixes in TAO 2.3a_p1</h3>
                   <UL>
                     <LI>Fix VxWorks build problem.</LI>
                     <LI>Fix IPv6 related issues that affect performance on newer Windows platforms</LI>
                     <LI>Improvments to the Implementation Repository</LI>
                     <UL>
                       <LI>New tao_imr kill command to signal an otherwise unresponsive server.</LI>
                       <LI>New tao_imr link command to identify groups of POAs that share a server.</LI>
                       <LI>ImR is better able to avoid errantly starting multiple server instances</LI>
                       <LI>Addressed several memory leaks and other assorted defects</LI>
                     </UL>
                     <LI>Added a new Client Strategy Factory option, -ORBDefaultSyncScope which
                       takes the label "None", "Transport", "Server", or "Target" to define the
                       sync scope to be used when a Messaging SyncScopePolicy is not in use.</LI>
                     <LI>Fix for extra CDR padding bytes following a request header when there are no
                       IN or INOUT arguments in the request. This happened when a request had at least
                       one OUT argument, and also had a service context that ended off a CDR alignment
                       boundary. While this is not a problem for TAO-TAO messaging, some non-TAO
                       servers will reject such requests with a MARSHAL exception. See bug 4141 for more
                       information.</LI>
                     <LI>Improved recursive typecode handling in the IDL compiler</LI>
                     <LI>Support for using StringValue types in IDL</LI>

                   </UL>

                     <h3>Features added since TAO 2.2a</h3>
                     <P>Many features have been added to ACE and TAO since the release of TAO 2.2a. A comprehensive listing is
                       available in the NEWS files of each of the major package root directories. See in particular summaries
                       from the top of the file down to the ACE-6.0.4, TAO-2.0.4, or CIAO-1.0.4 releases. </P>
                     <P>The following list provides some highlights.</P>
                     <UL>
                        <LI>Many performance improvements to the ACE/TAO core libraries.
                          <UL>
                            <LI>Generated skeleton code presents a smaller footprint, saving between 10 and 60% depending on use.</LI>
                            <LI>There is now a TIME_POLICY strategy manager allowing for dynamic selection of either system time or highres time</LI>
                            <LI>ZIOP compressed data performance is improved</LI>
                            <LI>Generated ValueType OBV_* classes now provide a _copy_value() hook method for better duplication support.</LI>
                            <LI>Multiple retries on invocation failures is now configurable. This works in conjunction with fault tolerant services to allow for transparent selection of the backup server if the primary fails</LI>
                            <LI>Improved MIOP implementation to support message fragmentation.</LI>
                            <LI>Added OpenSSL configuration options SSLCipherList and SSLServerCipherOrder to the SSLIOP_Factory. This allows the SSL/TLS BEAST exploit to be mitigated.</LI>
                            <LI>Extended CosNotifyFilter::FilterFactory to allow removal of filters created by the factory.</LI>
                          </UL>
                        </LI>
                        <LI>A new Dynamic Thread Pool is available for non-RT ORBs and POAs. This allows for automatic spawning of threads at runtime to some configured maximum as well as the destruction of spawned threads as load is reduced. Multiple thread pool definitions can be supplied via service configuration directives, then used by the ORB or POA. POAs may also be supplied dynamic thread pool configuration through new policy objects. Dynamic thread pools may be configured with a minimum and maximum thread counts, and an idle timeout. WHen the configured ORB or POA is activated, the minimum number of threads are spawned. The thread pool grows to the maximum count as load increases, then shrinks back to the minimum as threads sit idle. POA thread pools also accept a configurable message queue limit, above which requests are rejected.</LI>
                        <LI>The Naming Service and Implementation repository are now Fult Tolerant, supporting a dual-redundant configuration which provides replication and seamless failover between primary and back up servers.</LI>
                        <LI>Fault Tolerance is available for Naming and Implementation Repository services. This makes use of shared persistent state and communication between a primary and backup instance. Clients make use of automatic retry to switch from a failed primary to a back up server without application intervention.</LI>
                        <LI>Implementation Repository now uses asynchronous messaging to improve efficiency under heavy use conditions.</LI>
                        <LI>Implementation Repository is now able to register and launch JacORB servers. Requires JacORB 3.3 or later</LI>
                        <LI>New ORB initialization arguments:

               <P>Use the fast=1 instead of optimize=1 for optimizing with Sun compilers because

                  Other optimization levels may reduce the footprint, but do not have a
